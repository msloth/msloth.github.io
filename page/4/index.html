Saw a woman/girl that took photos of many of the nasty pics of mutilated bodies etc. Interesting. She seemed focused on those.
There were also devices from one of the worlds first wireless sensor network deployments on display, the ADSID.</div>

Siem Reap is a small town, ca 10.000 inhabitants, but it has a club I feel Stockholm is lacking. We joined some locals for some interesting dishes, and I quote, &#34;Egg has baby&#34;.</div>

More tuktuk
We didn&#39;t stay at AW, instead we left for Ta Prohm which is considered a sunset temple, ie looking better at the sunset. Thus, it&#39;s more empty during the morning.
Also visited Ta Keo.
Saw a cool centipede which fortunately enough was slow and didn&#39;t seem to have an appetite for human flesh.</div>

In front of other cops and tourists, without shame. I find it a little funny and gives him a bun (fika ftw!). Next thing, they ask for 25$ instead of 20$. Wasn&#39;t a problem though, I just said clearly and with my thunderous authority that it&#39;s only 20.</div>

SIGSTOP (19) stops the process, halts all execution but does not kill it. It cannot be trapped/ignored. SIGCONT (18) continues a process stopped with SIGSTOP. SIGINT (2) sends an interrupt to the process, which decides what to do with it. It can be trapped/ignored. Usually sent with ctrl&#43;C. SIGTERM (15) sends an irq to kill the process. This is a graceful way to kill it and lets it do what it needs before shutting down (eg saving data).</div>

The mobo has hardware accelerated decoding of HD material, built in WiFi, Bluetooth, comes with an IR remote, is fanless and uses a power brick instead of an ATX PSU. This last point (and HW decoding of course) is key. This way, the mobo can be fitted in a very small case, the Nintendo 8-bit NES being of ideal size, fitting the mobo, a 2.</div>
