With an appealing dome and satisfying loud click, you cannot not click the button. But it lacks an equally appealing enclosure.

We have previously looked at how to make a wireless device live for years on one tiny coin cell battery. This time we up the game and make it live forever, using solar power and off-the-shelf hardware.
We build a prototype of our device and go through the technical details involved in designing for solar power.</div>

Why 🔗Technology can even in its most raw and bare form certainly be beautiful. The bottom of a motherboard, with long, parallell, impedance-matched traces from PCI-connectors is a good example. A large BGA is another, with traces extending in every direction.
I&#39;ve long wanted to make my PCBs more beautiful, taking the few &#34;colors&#34; into full use.</div>

The soldered clock from above and bottom. There is a lot of solder flux residue, and lots of small black pieces of fabric from my bag, which lessens the appeal of the white solder mask. Quite nice though.</div>

There already exist a number of protocols for low-power wireless. Most of them are quite complex and hence use much RAM and ROM which makes them unfeasible for the Launchpad and similarly constrained systems. This is a simple yet efficient radio duty-cycling protocol for Contiki that achieves 3% idle listening duty cycle while allowing for an average 65 ms latency with no prior contact or synchronization.</div>

The TI Launchpad is based on a msp430g2452 and &#39;2553, which have 256/512 bytes of RAM and 16 kB ROM, and costs 10$. Thus it&#39;s a bit too small for Contiki, and there is no simple API for stuff like ADC or PWM.</div>

 the talk in handout-format a few slides source: Makefile source: a silent node source: a periodic broadcasting node  and finally a working Contiki copy (check out the Instant Contiki virtual machine with all tools set up from the beginning).</div>

It&#39;s likely the most capitalist country I&#39;ve ever seen actually. Everywhere you look, there are things for sale, stores and shopping malls.
