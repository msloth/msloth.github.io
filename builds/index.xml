      <title>Build: Subwoofer base</title>

      <description>Buildlog: Subwoofer base ğŸ”—Sneak peek ğŸ”—The thing upside down, painted.
Why ğŸ”—We recently bought a soundbar system for our TV. The system includes a subwoofer. Not great, not terrible, but enough to potentially disturb neighbors. This calls for some kind of stand to separate the subwoofer-structure from the house-structure.
Also, the sides are dressed in a fabric mesh, and I want to raise it from the floor enough so that the vacuum cleaner won&amp;rsquo;t hit it.</description>

      <title>Build: Clicker</title>
      <link>https://tiliaradix.com/builds/build-clicker/</link>

      <description>Buildlog: Clicker ğŸ”—Sneak peek ğŸ”—Clicker diorama.
Meta ğŸ”—The Clicker is a creature (?) in the world of The Last of Us, made by Naughty Dog.
Clicker.
The Clickers are originally humans, that have fallen to a fungus infection. The fungus, of the Cordyceps genus, affects, takes over, control over the body. It is famously documented on insects in the Planet Earth documentary, however the human infection is a fictious extrapolation as a plot device.</description>

      <description>Buildlog: Ohmu ğŸ”—This is the buildlog for my Ohmu diorama.
Sneak peek ğŸ”—Hello, Ohmu.
Meta ğŸ”—The Ohmu is a creature from the 1984 anime NausicaÃ¤ of the Valley of the Wind.
It was directed by Hayao Miyazaki, who co-founded Studio Ghibli.
Brief synopsis courtesy of Wikipedia:
 Taking place in a future post-apocalyptic world, the film tells the story of NausicaÃ¤ (Shimamoto), the young princess of the Valley of the Wind.</description>

      <title>Build: Brewtag</title>
      <link>https://tiliaradix.com/builds/build-brewtag/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 13 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://tiliaradix.com/builds/build-brewtag/</guid>
      <description>Buildlog: Brewtag ğŸ”—The Goal ğŸ”—Design a small sensor board that runs off coin cell batteries and uses high-accuracy sensors, for use in measuring ambient pressure differences of an elevator moving from floor to floor.
The Challenge ğŸ”—Small size, low cost, RF performance, EMI compliance, and protected against user errors such as battery upside down.
The Result ğŸ”—Mechanics, enclosure ğŸ”—Schematics ğŸ”—Layout ğŸ”—</description>

      <title>Build: DigiDev</title>
      <link>https://tiliaradix.com/builds/build-digidev/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 13 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://tiliaradix.com/builds/build-digidev/</guid>
      <description>Buildlog: DigiDev ğŸ”—The Goal ğŸ”—Design a board using inexpensive 2-layer design.
The Challenge ğŸ”—2-layer designs present challenges with RF compared to 4-layer designs, since the larger distance from signal layer to ground plane affects the RF negatively.
The Result ğŸ”—Using the thinnest PCB stackup the board house offers, and adjusting the RF path accordingly, the board has excellent RF performance while being a more cost efficient alternative to 4-layer designs.</description>

      <title>Build: Ethernet CC1310 Gateway - eth1310</title>
      <link>https://tiliaradix.com/builds/build-eth1310/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 13 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://tiliaradix.com/builds/build-eth1310/</guid>
      <description>Buildlog: eth1310 ğŸ”—The Goal ğŸ”—Design a sub-GHz to Ethernet gateway that is cost efficient. Minimize size while still being able to solder by hand.
The Challenge ğŸ”—Ethernet and the CC1310 sub-GHz both present EMI challenges if not properly handled. RF and oscillator components should be as small as possible.
The Result ğŸ”—A 4 by 10 cm board with excellent RF performance, power from USB-C, and no EMI issues.
