    <div class="content">
      <p>Background, was running my Iphone 4 with 4.2.1 and tethered jailbreak using redsn0w 0.9.6.4b. I wanted to update it to 4.3.3 to both get rid of the tethered boot (ie, to boot up the phone, it must be connected to my Macbook and I must go through a keypress kombo (not the Konami-code ;) ) and to get the convenience of Wifi-hotspots.</p>
<p>Itunes didn't like me though so it kept saying <em>&quot;this device is not eligible for the requested build&quot;</em> when it came to the 'verifiying with Apple' stage. Tried lots of things, and I had the latest Itunes etc. This accumulation of tricks I found on various sites is what finally helped:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>sync and backup the phone first! (sync, then rightclick and choose 'backup', maybe not necessary with both?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Downloaded the 4.3.3 restore IPSW (google for it)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removed the gs.apple.com entry in hosts-file (entry added automatically when jailbreaking, if Itunes finds it, it will stop with error 1013); enter the following and then quit and save by ctrl+X, then Y, then enter <code>sudo nano /etc/hosts</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>switched off the phone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>plugged it in with USB</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>entered DFU mode (same as when you jailbreak: power 5 sec, power+home 10 sec, home 5 sec, don't let go of buttons between). Now the phone will show up in Itunes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>hold alt/option + command buttons when pressing the 'restore'-button in Itunes; this will let you choose what firmware to restore from</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>point to the 4.3.3 firmware you downloaded</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>then Itunes will process and work and finally the phone will boot, completely empty w firmware 4.3.3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the dialog 'Set up your iphone' you can choose to restore it (poor choice of words) from the backup that you took right before this procedure</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After all this, I jailbroke it with the 4.3.3 untethered, reinstalled Pkgbackup and let it restore the jailbreak-apps and settings I had.</p>
