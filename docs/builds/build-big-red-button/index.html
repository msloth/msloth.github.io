<p>With an appealing dome and satisfying loud <em>click</em>, you cannot <em>not</em> click the button. But it lacks an equally appealing enclosure.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s build one out of concrete.</p>
<p>For this project, I used</p>
<ul>
<li>1 Texas Instruments Sensortag</li>
<li>1 Adafruit Big Red Button</li>
<li>1 RGB LED</li>
<li>Prototyping cables</li>
<li>Concrete</li>

<h2 id="why">Why <a href="#why" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><p>Why not?</p>

  <img src="/img/builds/big-red-button/20170926--114515.jpg" alt="Group of buttons" loading="lazy"  />
</p>
<em>Well, well, well.</em></p>
<p>The button can be disassembled into a base socket, top button, and switch assembly.</p>
<p>We will use the base socket (upper right in the picture) and mold the concrete around it. Thus, the button will be firmly fixed in concrete.</p>
<p><p class="markdown-image">
  <img src="/img/builds/big-red-button/IMG_20171019_134741.jpg" alt="disassembled" loading="lazy"  />
</p>
<em>Disassembled.</em></p>
<h2 id="concrete">Concrete <a href="#concrete" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><p>It&rsquo;s easy to make something in concrete. To start with, we need to gather some things. Of course, we need the concrete itself.</p>
<p>Just head to one of the large warehouses for construction material and buy a large bag of fine-grained concrete. I got mine from <a href="www.bauhaus.se">Bauhaus</a>.</p>
<p><p class="markdown-image">
  <img src="/img/builds/big-red-button/IMG_20171008_121039.jpg" alt="Concrete bag." loading="lazy"  />
</p>
<em>Concrete bag.</em></p>
<h2 id="make-a-mold">Make a mold <a href="#make-a-mold" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><p>Making a mold is rather easy, but you need to think in negative terms and think ahead of where you need to have empty space (ie no concrete). You need to think about the outer shape, and any holes and openings. Here, I used an old bowl and a plastic bottle.</p>
<p>The bottle is used for the negative space which will be under the button and house the electronics, so it has to be large enough. I cut off the top of the bottle and hot-glued it to the button underside.</p>
<p><p class="markdown-image">
  <img src="/img/builds/big-red-button/IMG_20171010_091026.jpg" alt="Mold." loading="lazy"  />
</p>
<em>The Mold in all its glory.</em></p>
<p>Using ordinary house-hold food oil, I lube the bowl so the concrete won&rsquo;t stick. The button socket <em>should</em> stick, so no oil on that one. Same for the bottle.</p>
<h2 id="mix-and-pour-and-wait">Mix and Pour and Wait <a href="#mix-and-pour-and-wait" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><h3 id="mix">Mix <a href="#mix" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><p>For this step, you should keep in mind that eyes or lungs does not combine very well with concrete, and concrete is very dusty. It is also corrosive and not cool to have on your body. Use suitable protection and clean yourself up as soon as possible afterwards.</p>
<p>Pour some concrete into a large container of some kind. Add a little water and start mixing carefully - dust will fly! It&rsquo;s done when it&rsquo;s thouroghly mixed and has a consistency like thick porridge.</p>
<p><p class="markdown-image">
  <img src="/img/builds/big-red-button/IMG_20171010_091856.jpg" alt="Concrete." loading="lazy"  />
</p>
<em>Concrete mix.</em></p>
<h3 id="pour">Pour <a href="#pour" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><p>Now pour the concrete into the mold. Since the button-bottle insert is not glued into the bowl, hold it down with one hand while pouring the concrete with a small spade. It might also float up so keep it pressed down.</p>
<p>A problem, depending on your viewpoint on aesthetics, is that concrete has a lot of trapped air. Tap the outside of the bowl from time to time to help air float to the top and escape. Otherwise, there will be bubbles which will result in small holes on the surface as you can see in the first picture. Myself, I kind of like the lunar-like surface; it makes for an interesting texture when feeling it.</p>
<p><p class="markdown-image">
  <img src="/img/builds/big-red-button/IMG_20171010_092201.jpg" alt="About to dry." loading="lazy"  />
</p>
<em>About to dry.</em></p>
<h3 id="wait">Wait <a href="#wait" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><p>Concrete needs to harden through an exotermic process called &ldquo;burning&rdquo;. Don&rsquo;t worry, there are no flames, not even noticeably higher temperatures. The concrete needs moisture for this process or it will risk cracking and being generally structurally unsound. So, once a day I sprinkled a little water on the surface.</p>
<p>The burn time depends on how thick the concrete is, but I waited three days in total. I kept a small weight on the bottle to keep it down.</p>
<p><p class="markdown-image">
  <img src="/img/builds/big-red-button/IMG_20171011_204335.jpg" alt="Pretty dry." loading="lazy"  />
</p>
<em>Dry.</em></p>
<p>I did this on our balcony, and used a TI Sensortag running Thingsquare to keep track of the temperature. The concrete needs special attention if used in lower than +5 degrees Celsius.</p>
<h2 id="extract-and-construct">Extract and Construct <a href="#extract-and-construct" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><h3 id="extract">Extract <a href="#extract" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><p>After a couple of days, it was done. I removed the mold and cleaned up hard edges with a bit of 200 grit sandpaper. Using a knife I cut off the parts of the bottle that were sticking out. I also added a couple of pads to the bottom so it wouldn&rsquo;t scratch the surface of what it stands on.</p>
<p><p class="markdown-image">
  <img src="/img/builds/big-red-button/IMG_20171014_102812.jpg" alt="Pretty." loading="lazy"  />
</p>
<em>Pretty.</em></p>
<p>Turns out, it weighs about 2.8 kg. That&rsquo;s a nice and heavy feel.</p>
<h3 id="feet">Feet <a href="#feet" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><p>2.8 kg can inflict some serious scratches on other things, so let&rsquo;s put it on feet.</p>
<p><p class="markdown-image">
  <img src="/img/builds/big-red-button/IMG_20171014_103456.jpg" alt="Feeted." loading="lazy"  />
</p>
<em>Feeted.</em></p>
<h2 id="electronics">Electronics <a href="#electronics" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><p>Now we have a large button concrete. Time to add some smarts. The interior space is quite large, but not large enough for a TI Launchpad, so I used a TI Sensortag for this purpose.</p>
<p>There are two signals we want to route to the Sensortag: the button of course, but it also has an integrated LED.</p>
<p>First, remove the stock button LED (which has a current limiting resistor for 12V) and add our own LED with resistor for 3.3V. I soldered wires to the button terminals for normally-opened, and to the LED. These should then go to the Sensortag, but where?</p>
<h3 id="tweak-the-sensortag">Tweak the Sensortag <a href="#tweak-the-sensortag" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><p>The Sensortag comes in a couple of flavors, one is sub-GHz with a CC1350, and another is on the 2.4 GHz band with a CC2650. Thingsquare has support for them both, but I picked the 2.4 GHz more or less since it was closer to me on my desk, I&rsquo;m kind of reluctant to say 😄.</p>
<p>Ok, so the Sensortag is a reference design and as such the full schematics and diagrams are published by <a href="http://www.ti.com/tool/TIDC-CC2650STK-SENSORTAG" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Texas Instruments.</a></p>
<p>From the schematic, I see that LEDs are active high, and buttons are active low. This tells me how to connect the button and LED.</p>
<p>Now I need to find <em>where</em> on the Sensortag I should solder the wires. I see on the assembly diagram how to do this.</p>
<p><p class="markdown-image">
  <img src="/img/builds/big-red-button/button-led.png" alt="LED." loading="lazy"  />
</p>
<em>Here for the LED.</em></p>
<p><p class="markdown-image">
  <img src="/img/builds/big-red-button/button-switch.png" alt="Switch." loading="lazy"  />
</p>
<em>Here for the Switch.</em></p>
<p>First, I clip away the switch from the Sensortag and clean up the pads. Then, to save power, the LED on the Sensortag is removed too. The ground terminal is the oval slot next to the battery clip.</p>
<p><p class="markdown-image">
  <img src="/img/builds/big-red-button/tag-switch.png" alt="On Tag." loading="lazy"  />
</p>
<em>Sensortag hardware hacked.</em></p>
<p>Now, I can solder the cables to the button to these pads. Et voila, button and LED is connected to the Sensortag and no software modification is necessary.</p>
<h2 id="full-on-glory">Full-on Glory <a href="#full-on-glory" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><p>Now, I assemble it all, and insert a coin cell battery. The Sensortag boots up and I connect it to the gateway, then in the Thingsquare app (<a href="http://www.thingsquare.com/app/%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.thingsquare.com/app/)</a>, enable remote access and set notifications. Next up, I configure it to send data less often since I primarily want to use this as a button and has sensor data from other Sensortags already. This will give me longer lifetime on a battery.</p>
<p>Finally, I share the button with the office account so that we all can control it and get notifications.</p>
<h2 id="bonus">Bonus <a href="#bonus" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><p>I actually went and moss&rsquo;ed it up later on. I took moss from the forest, mixed some with  yoghurt to act as glue, then smeared it on the concrete.</p>
<p>After a while, the moss had affixed to the concrete pretty good! It looked and felt great, but it quickly dried out, so I had to frequently water it. That killed the electronics.</p>
<p><p class="markdown-image">
  <img src="/img/builds/big-red-button/moss.jpg" alt="Moss." loading="lazy"  />
</p>
<em>Pre-mossing moss.</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately no pic of the mossed button, but a pic of the moss pre-mossing!</p>
