      <p>So Roger (a friend of mine) and I each bought ourselves a new HTPC. It is based on an Asus AT3IonT-I deluxe Mini-ITX motherboard in a NES chassis. The mobo has hardware accelerated decoding of HD material, built in WiFi, Bluetooth, comes with an IR remote, is fanless and uses a power brick instead of an ATX PSU.</p>

<em>Finished look. There&rsquo;s an IR receiver eye in the black part.</em></p>
<p>This last point (and HW decoding of course) is key. This way, the mobo can be fitted in a very small case, the Nintendo 8-bit NES being of ideal size, fitting the mobo, a 2.5&quot; HD, a fan etc.</p>
<p>My goal is to have a small, (completely) silent HTPC that I can watch HD movies and play emulators on. This mobo uses a power brick instead of a normal PSU so power for HDs etc is routed through the mobo via a molex connector to max 3 SATA devices.</p>
<p>For both me and Roger, the included cable was assembled wrongly ü§¶ ; +5V and +12V had switched places so we fried a HD before we saw the error. I am currently in the process of getting the HD reimbursed; I soldered a new cable which works great.</p>
<p>So this was the plan which was executed:</p>
<ul>
<li>adapt the NES chassis with a Dremel so that the mobo et al fits</li>
<li>install XBMC</li>
<li>stream movies via SMB from a NAS</li>
</ul>

</p>
<em>I couldn&rsquo;t use the NES power button as-is, so had to fit the mobo power toggle at the inside of cartridge slot.</em></p>

<em>Messy innards, barely fitting.</em></p>

</p>
<em>It&rsquo;s alive!</em></p>
<p><strong>Edit in 2022:</strong> <em>(record scratch)</em> This all worked fine a few years. Then my power brick broke. Roger had already modernized his setup so I got his. That gave life for this a few more years. I moved it out of the NES enclosure, and into a mini enclosure since I needed more disks. From there I went to a NAS and a small raspberry pi.</p>
<p>What killed it was essentially lack of hardware support for hardware-accelerated video decoding.</p>
