While tanks aren&rsquo;t that usual, more common is it to find old cars.</p>
<p>This diorama is a play on that theme.</p>
<p>Here, a farmer had a German WW2 tank in his barn, forgotten in time. It&rsquo;s unused since it first got there, perhaps waiting for a fix of something, that never got to be.</p>
<p>Debris and dirt has accumulated on the tank, as is common with barn finds forgotten in time. It&rsquo;s partly swept over by a large covering tarp.</p>
<p><p class="markdown-image">
  <img src="/img/builds/barnfind/tigerB.jpg" alt="Tiger II" loading="lazy"  />
</p></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_II" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Tiger II</em>.</a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_II" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Tiger II</strong></a> is a German heavy tank. Weight close to 70 metric tonne (ie 70k kg) with up to 180 mm armor (in the front of the turret).</p>
<p>Other names of this tank are,</p>
<ul>
<li>Panzerkampfwagen Tiger Ausf. B</li>
<li>Tiger B</li>
<li>Sd.Kfz. 182</li>
<li>King Tiger</li>
<li>Köningstiger</li>
</ul>
<p>The gun was an 88mm gun. The long range of the gun, and thick armor in front, made it a strong tank in head-on combat.</p>
<p>Close to 500 units were built, and used 1944 &ndash; 1945.</p>
<p>The scale of this diorama is circa 1/117, determined by the size of the 3D-printed tank. That size in turn was set when I printed it - I wanted to print a tank of ca 2.5 cm height.</p>
<h2 id="tiger-ii">Tiger II <a href="#tiger-ii" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><h3 id="3d-print">3D print <a href="#3d-print" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><p>The tank was printed with the <strong>Prusa MK3S</strong> extruder printer, with Prusament filament, lightblue. The layer height was again pretty chunky in order to reduce print time.</p>
<p><p class="markdown-image">
  <img src="/img/builds/barnfind/IMG_20190405_142448.jpg" alt="Fresh print out of the printer." loading="lazy"  />
</p>
<em>Fresh print out of the printer. Time to remove supports.</em></p>
<p><p class="markdown-image">
  <img src="/img/builds/barnfind/IMG_20190405_142842.jpg" alt="Supports removed, assembled." loading="lazy"  />
</p>
<em>Supports removed, assembled.</em></p>
<p>So, again, I painted the print with diluted PVA glue to fill in some layers. Then base coated/primed it with black acrylics.</p>
<h3 id="tarp">Tarp <a href="#tarp" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><p>This came to be through experimenting with how to create fabric, for another diorama. This version with thin decorative paper, doused in diluted PVA glue, was put to dry over the printed tank. The shape of this came out so well, so I wanted to make a diorama from this.</p>
<p>The tarp is pretty fragile, so more PVA was added to stiffen it up.</p>
<p><p class="markdown-image">
  <img src="/img/builds/barnfind/IMG_20220325_201934.jpg" alt="First sketch." loading="lazy"  />
</p>
<em>First draft directly on the base.</em></p>
<h3 id="paint">Paint <a href="#paint" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><p><p class="markdown-image">
  <img src="/img/builds/barnfind/IMG_20220331_075124.jpg" alt="Painted black." loading="lazy"  />
</p>
<em>Base coat/primer</em>.</p>
<h2 id="base">Base <a href="#base" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><p>The base is a rectangular piece of plain MDF, 18 mm thick. It is sealed by a couple of layers of PVA glue (wood glue). Then painted black on the sides, and rubber feet on the bottom.</p>
<h2 id="barn">Barn <a href="#barn" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><p>The barn is loosely modeled after Swedish barns, because why not. The color is the typical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falu_red" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Falu red</a>, with white edges. The Falu red paint is a byproduct from mining in mines in Falun. The sludge is heated a few hours, mixed with oil etc. This paint turned out to have nice wood-preserving properties, and it presumably was nice that the color resembled the color of brick, used in more expensive buildings.</p>
<h3 id="house-frame">House frame <a href="#house-frame" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><p>The frame is built in balsa wood, spliced into three parts from a long 1 x 0.5 cm rod. Cut with an exacto knife, glued into place.</p>
<p><p class="markdown-image">

<em>Roof frame from balsa. Some metal fasteners are made from alu-foil and glued in corners.</em></p>
<p><p class="markdown-image">

</p>
<em>Detail. Three angular metal fastener things in the corner.</em></p>
<h3 id="roof">Roof <a href="#roof" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><p>The roof is made of thick aluminium foil from a take-away food container. To get the corrugated surface, I ran one of the clay tools along a ruler repeatedly, when lying on my soft cutting mat. This was tedious, but worked out nice. I think the scale is off though.</p>

</p>
<em>Corrugated roof from aluminium foil.</em></p>
<h3 id="gutter">Gutter <a href="#gutter" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><p>I made a gutter from alu-foil, and an oil drum that collects rain water.</p>
<p>The oil drum is made by cutting a rectangular alu-foil strip, then pressing a sharp object in two lines to create the protruding lines. Wrap it around a cylindrical tool, then glue.</p>

</p>
<em>Pretty small and fuzzy.</em></p>
<h3 id="inside">Inside <a href="#inside" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><p>The inside of the barn couldn&rsquo;t be empty apart from the tank. Some debris was built to fit in between the wall and the tank. The thinking is that the barn served as a storage area for various junk over the years.</p>
<p>An old door frame.</p>
