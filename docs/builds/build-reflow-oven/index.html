<em>The reflow oven hard at work.</em></p>
<h2 id="meta">Meta <a href="#meta" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><p>&ldquo;Professional&rdquo; reflow ovens are pretty expensive.</p>
<p>Simple solution - use a small convection oven, add a precision temperature sensor and a controller, and let the controller heat the oven!</p>
<h2 id="why">Why <a href="#why" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><p>SMD components are smaller, and many many components doesn&rsquo;t even come as through-hole parts (THP) nowadays. It&rsquo;s also generally cheaper, and the resulting PCB can be made smaller.</p>
<p>With SMD (surface mounted devices) components, it can be a bit harder to solder than THPs, since the pads are smaller. They can be so small, that it is barely visible with the naked eye (to someone my age, you young summer child).</p>
<p>With a reflow oven, you can solder the whole board in one go, and you remove a pretty error-prone part in the process by offloading this to a controller, which controls the heating profile.</p>
<p>This also enables you to use even smaller components, that may not have been solderable by hand anyway. For example, pads underneath the components (eg on RF modules), pads without legs, etc.</p>
<h2 id="convection-oven">Convection oven <a href="#convection-oven" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><p>There are many hobbyist DIY versions posted all over the internet. Commonly, they use a low-cost, small convection oven which retails at about 60-80 USD, and a controlling unit.</p>
<p><strong>Important notice: the oven obviously should not be used for anything with food after even a single use as reflow oven.</strong> It&rsquo;s not worth being poisoned.</p>
<h2 id="beta-layout-controller">Beta Layout controller <a href="#beta-layout-controller" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><p>The controlling unit basically does one thing - read the current temperature, and control the heating element so that the temperature follows the reflow temperature curve. The curve depends on eg components used and the soldering paste.</p>
<p>A very appealing offer (no affiliation, just a happy customer) is the kit by <a href="https://uk.beta-layout.com/estore/order_product_details.html?wg=1&amp;p=740" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beta Layout</a>. At a cost of ca 400€, you get a controller, an oven, some accessories and a test PCB with components.</p>
<p>(Sure, DIY is probably cheaper, but unless think that&rsquo;s the fun part of this whole ordeal, ain&rsquo;t nobody got time for that. I rather spend it reflowing the fun things I&rsquo;ve designed for other things.)</p>

<em>Beta Layout kit.</em></p>
<p>The whole thing just weighs a few kilos and is easily movable. No need for a dedicated space for it unless you do a lot of reflows. But, ensure proper ventilation and don&rsquo;t lick the insides of the oven, nor the PCB.</p>
<h2 id="soldering-paste">Soldering paste <a href="#soldering-paste" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><p>The soldering paste is basically a thick paste of solder balls of miniscule size, suspended in flux. This is applied to the pads on the PCB, where the components are placed.</p>
<p>When the oven heats up, it melts the solder paste, which becomes liquid. Surface tension pulls and aligns (to a certain grade) the component onto the pads.</p>
<p>The only caveat is to learn how to apply the perfect amount of solder paste. Too much and you&rsquo;ll have bridges.</p>
<h2 id="pcb-stencil">PCB stencil <a href="#pcb-stencil" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><p>In very simple cases, solder paste can be applied manually with a syringe, but it&rsquo;s inexpensive to order a stencil when ordering the PCB manufacture. Tick a checkbox, pay a couple dollars more, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p><p class="markdown-image">

</p>
<em>Applying solder paste with stencil.</em></p>
<p>The stencil is fitted correctly over the PCB. Then a glob of solder paste is smeared evenly over the stencil, which scrapes it down the holes and onto the pads.</p>
<p><p class="markdown-image">
  <img src="/img/builds/reflow-oven/IMG_20190122_160647.jpg" alt="Applied solder paste." loading="lazy"  />
</p>
<em>Applied solder paste.</em></p>
<p>Components are then placed on the solder pasted pads. Of course you need to ensure polarity and the like, but extreme line-up and alignement isn&rsquo;t necessary. When the solder paste melts, surface tension aligns the component.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage <a href="#usage" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><p>Assemble the reflow oven per the instructions. In this case, it is extremely simple.</p>
<p>The controller is connected to a wall outlet. It has two connectors, one for a temperature sensor which then goes into the oven. A second is for the power cord to the oven itself.</p>
<p>Convection ovens aren&rsquo;t always very good at maintaining a steady temperature, but simply laying some kitchen alu-foil against the glass helps quite a bit.</p>
<p>Some alu-foil is also placed on the bars where the PCB later is placed, since the bars will heat up and in turn heat the PCB unevenly. A folded alu-foil separates the PCB from the bars enough that this isn&rsquo;t a problem.</p>

</p>
<em>Inside the oven.</em></p>
<p>Then just place the PCBs on the alu-foiled bar plate, start the controller, and wait ca 15 minutes.</p>

</p>
<em>Waiting.</em></p>
<p>Let it cool off, take the PCBs out, let them cool.</p>
