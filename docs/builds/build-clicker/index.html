Clicker.
The Clickers are originally humans, that have fallen to a fungus infection. The fungus, of the Cordyceps genus, affects, takes over, control over the body. It is famously documented on insects in the Planet Earth documentary, however the human infection is a fictious extrapolation as a plot device.">

<em>Clicker diorama.</em></p>
<h2 id="meta">Meta <a href="#meta" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><p>The Clicker is a creature (?) in the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/sv-se/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">world</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Last of Us</a>, made by <a href="https://www.naughtydog.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Naughty Dog</a>.</p>
<p><p class="markdown-image">

</p></p>
<p><em>Clicker.</em></p>
<p>The Clickers are originally humans, that have fallen to a fungus infection. The fungus, of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordyceps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cordyceps</a> genus, affects, takes over, control over the body. It is famously documented on insects in the Planet Earth documentary, however the human infection is a fictious extrapolation as a plot device.</p>
<p>After a long infection time, the fungus grows spores out of various parts of the body, including the head, and creates the iconic look of the Clicker. The eyes becomes unusable, and the creature uses clicks as a form of echo-location, hence the name.</p>
<p>In the games (there are two, and an add-on to the first game), Clickers are quite tough and can be an real scare when they hear you and come lunging for you.</p>
<p>TLoU is currently filming with HBO as a TV series, very exciting.</p>
<h2 id="clicker-bust">Clicker bust <a href="#clicker-bust" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><p>The Clicker bust is a <a href="https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-the-last-of-us-clickers-3278" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3D-print</a> which I printed on a Prusa MK3S extruder printer. The filament was Prusament, light blue. It was a small print, and layer height was rather high (ie I preferred printing faster).</p>
<p><p class="markdown-image">
  <img src="/img/builds/clicker/IMG_20210818_222057.jpg" alt="3D-printed and poorly painted bust." loading="lazy"  />
</p>
<em>3D-printed and poorly painted bust. The backpack etc are made from polymer clay, but not used in this diorama.</em></p>
<p>This meant that there were plenty of visible layer lines, so I first &ldquo;painted&rdquo; it with diluted PVA (wood glue) a couple of times to fill in the gaps.</p>
<p>I had not really meant to do anything with it, but I started painting it for practice, and it started to turn out nice so I went along with it.</p>
<p>In hindsight, I wish I didn&rsquo;t go for such a dark green color for skin. I didn&rsquo;t really intend for that either, it was supposed to be a darkening filter for the <em>real</em> skin color, but it was <em>too</em> dark.</p>
<p>The fungus growth followed the lore more or less. Kind of beige, with redder parts.</p>
<p>I made hair from synthetic fibers, doused in color to darken and lump together. Glued it to the bust with PVA glue, and affixed some leafs in it. I assume Clickers don&rsquo;t care about their hair style very much.</p>
<h2 id="base">Base <a href="#base" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><p>The base is an old wooden game where you roll around a ball. I removed the inserts and kept basically just the frame. Then filled it with concrete to give it weight and stability.</p>
<p>It was then spray-painted black.</p>
<p><p class="markdown-image">

</p>
<em>Rubble applied.</em></p>
<h2 id="concrete-block">Concrete block <a href="#concrete-block" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><p>I came to the thought that a bust needs a podium, so I made one from polymer clay, Fimo Professional. Lumped into coursely around a block of aluminium foil. I made one corner broken, with rebar sticking out, made from metal wire.</p>
<p>After some paint, I wanted more texture, so glued some fine sand here and there.</p>
<p><p class="markdown-image">
  <img src="/img/builds/clicker/IMG_20211112_141049.jpg" alt="Concrete block podium." loading="lazy"  />
</p>
<em>Concrete block podium and some texture tests.</em></p>
<p>The mood I wanted was a damp, left-over and damaged lump of concrete. The rebar is rusty, by a number of dark red to orange colors. Some moss is visible on some edges.</p>
<p>Water has pooled on the top surface, and edges sticking out. Water also runs down the sides. Not very very happy about this part. Especially since nothing else in the diorama is especially wet.</p>
<h3 id="spray-paint">Spray paint <a href="#spray-paint" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><p>In the game, the group calling themselves &ldquo;Fireflies&rdquo; is essential to the story. In lots of places throughout the game, you can find graffiti of the Firefly logo, a stylized firefly. This Firefly logo is also on the concrete block.</p>
<p>The look I was after was a spray paint with a stencil, where the person painting it was a bit sloppy. Holding the stencil with the left hand and spray painting with the right, it seems right that it would be top right corner of the stencil that doesn&rsquo;t lie flat, and thus, we both get some over-spray, and spray fuzziness. Some spray runs down where applied too much.</p>
<p>This was created by stippling paint and with paintbrush.</p>
<p><p class="markdown-image">
  <img src="/img/builds/clicker/decal.jpg" alt="Firefly logo." loading="lazy"  />
</p>
<em>Sloppily painted Firefly logo.</em></p>
<h2 id="road-sign">Road sign <a href="#road-sign" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><p>To add some color, I decided to make a road sign. At first, I thought of the iconic TLoU &ldquo;STOP&rdquo;-sign with a Firefly-logo, but that&rsquo;s a bit worn. Instead, I went with a &ldquo;No entry&rdquo;-sign.</p>
<p>The sign itself is made of metal sheet. Thicker than kitchen alu foil, this came from the bottom of a take-away food container.</p>
<p>I wanted something more exciting than a plain sign, so added the concept of &ldquo;used for target practice or adjusting a scope&rdquo;. Figured the idea went like, someone spraypainted a black blotch to aim at, then went a bit from the sign and shot a few rounds, adjusting the scope accordingly. First shots went high and a little to the sides, then center a couple of rounds.</p>

</p>
<em>Road sign, shot at and tipped over, but not weathered yet.</em></p>
<h2 id="debris">Debris <a href="#debris" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><p>I wanted something more to happen in the diorama, so I added some debris around the podium.</p>
<p>Leaves (birch seeds picked outside), small branches (twigs), and rubble (small stones and sand) completed the picture.</p>
<p>A brick made of Fimo polymer clay, was painted red and got some weathering. It was then placed next to the podium. Bricks are important in the game, hence important to me. 😄</p>
<p>Everything was glued together with PVA wood glue.</p>
