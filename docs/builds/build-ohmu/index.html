<p>Brief synopsis courtesy of Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
Taking place in a future post-apocalyptic world, the film tells the story of Nausicaä (Shimamoto), the young princess of the Valley of the Wind. She becomes embroiled in a struggle with Tolmekia, a kingdom that tries to use an ancient weapon to eradicate a jungle full of giant mutant insects.

In their normal state, they roam docile around the world. When attacked or angered, their normally blue eyes turn red and they can rush quickly.</p>
<p>Their armor is thick and impenetrable by most weapons.</p>

<h2 id="build">Build <a href="#build" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><h3 id="ohmu-1">Ohmu <a href="#ohmu-1" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><h4 id="clay">Clay <a href="#clay" class="anchor">🔗</a></h4><p>It all started with, after having seen the movie, me making a small Ohmu as a practice object with clay. I use oven hardening Fimo Professional. I didn&rsquo;t intend doing much with it, but I kind of liked the looks of it, and it was good practice.</p>
<p>I have no pictures of this unpainted, unfortunately.</p>
<h4 id="paint">Paint <a href="#paint" class="anchor">🔗</a></h4><p>I tried painting it, also for practice, and it looked pretty good! I used Vallejo paints for this.</p>
<p>I chose to picture it angry, with red eyes.</p>
<p><p class="markdown-image">
  <img src="/img/builds/ohmu/IMG_20211014_161209.jpg" alt="A first test of the Ohmu on outlined terrain." loading="lazy"  />
</p>
<em>A first test of the Ohmu on outlined terrain.</em></p>
<h3 id="base">Base <a href="#base" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><p>The foundation of the base is a black small photo frame, 10 by 15 cm.</p>
<p>The glass was removed, then the back part painted all black and the siderest removed so it can lie flat.</p>
<h3 id="terrain">Terrain <a href="#terrain" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><p>I had at first envisioned a landscape with hills and small animals running away from the path of the angry Ohmu. In lieu of the proper materials, and I didn&rsquo;t want to wait for them to arrive, I instead pivoted to a field with trees and various nature elements. A forest would call for more trees than my patience could handle.</p>
<p>The Ohmu is rushing, creating a long streak of upset terrain. Rocks and earth is visible, like after a farmer turning the soil. A tree in its path is flipped over.</p>
<h4 id="ground">Ground <a href="#ground" class="anchor">🔗</a></h4><p>The ground texture is made mostly with a homemade texture paste. This paste is a mix of,</p>
<ul>
<li>coffee grounds - used for morning coffee, then dried in a frying pan</li>
<li>PVA glue</li>
<li>a little water to get the proper consistency</li>
</ul>
<p><p class="markdown-image">
  <img src="/img/builds/ohmu/IMG_20211120_203622.jpg" alt="Terrain." loading="lazy"  />
</p>
<em>Terrain texture pastes.</em></p>
<p>Smearing the paste around in layers, allowing to dry between, I could build some height differences and the tracks of turned soil after the Ohmu.</p>
<p><p class="markdown-image">

</p></p>
<p><em>After grey and black primer sprays.</em></p>
<p>The ground is painted with many different green shades to get some variation, and some darker in the more recessed grasslands to emulate more moist in the ground there.</p>
<p>Flowers are simply painted on top of the ground layer.</p>
<p><p class="markdown-image">
  <img src="/img/builds/ohmu/IMG_20211124_100329.jpg" alt="First colors." loading="lazy"  />
</p>
<em>Some first color.</em></p>
<h4 id="rocks">Rocks <a href="#rocks" class="anchor">🔗</a></h4><p>Rocks are real rocks, picked from outside. Then boiled for a while to kill off biological stuff, and dried. Glued into place with PVA glue.</p>
<h4 id="trees">Trees <a href="#trees" class="anchor">🔗</a></h4><p>The trees are built using copper wire, twisted into shape. Regular wood PVA glue is painted on the stems and branches to bridge the gaps.</p>
<p>The foliage is made from small pieces of torn foam, from a regular foam sponge. Painted in various colors, for some variation.</p>
<p>The roots extend into the ground. Around some trees - mainly the birch-like trees - there are yellow-orange flowers. Those would be so small so I couldn&rsquo;t find any suitable physical shape to represent flowers, and simply had to paint directly on the grass.</p>
<p>There are mainly two kinds of trees: a birch-like, and a pine-like tree. Their color schemes reflect this.</p>
