      <p>I arrived in Shenzhen and had quite the difficulties finding the hotel, even though I followed the directions from a commenter on hotels.com. It is a very cheap hotel, only 130 RMB/night (the others ranged 400-600). I soon found out why. The building also housed a lot of apartments and other stuff. I got a room at the 11th floor of 30. There was no free dinner reception, no complimentary wifi (but I could borrow the managers computer on the 28th floor, if I wanted to let them log every credential and login I would enter. How about no.), the shared bathroom was quite shabby, you could rent a room for 2 hours of you'd like and by the bed was a set of condoms, lube and tickler that you could buy. But no minibar. At least they got their priorities set.</p>

<p>I pictured myself fending my way between pimps and hoes trying to get in at night. Pims with lots of gold and perhaps grills. Chinese pimps. Thankfully, it wasn't as bad as it sounds; no pimps/hoes/late night massage offers. What happened was another kind of orgasm.
The nerdgasm.</p>
<p>Thanks to tips from Roger (I'm ever grateful! My life is better after this experience!), I went to the neighborhoods where they have building after building with electronics resellers, and not the funny USB-stick with faked size, no no, components! Capacitors, inductors, switches, CPUs, FPGAs, PCBs, DSPs, anything (almost) that you can imagine!</p>
<p><p class="markdown-image">

</p></p>
<p>There seemed to be mainly five kinds of resellers:</p>
<ul>
<li>selling phones, phone accessories etc</li>
<li>selling new components on roll or piecewise</li>
<li>selling used PCBs (circuit boards) to others so they can desolder components and&hellip;</li>
<li>selling desoldered, reused components</li>
<li>then the ones selling equipment or their PCB design/manufacturing services.</li>
</ul>

<p>It was awesome. Pure omg. First day though, I arrived with only 30min before closing time and the other day two hours as I wanted to go to HK too late. I bought some 10W LED, a 30W LED, some flux, port expanders etc. I was missing sensors though, couldn't find anyone specialized on that. Seemed like the theme (of these two buildings at least) was phones/portable media devices, or LED signs/lights.</p>
<p>I bought these. :)</p>

<p>Other things I did: went to a market and bought two pairs of shoes (140/230 RMB) and some bumpers (15/60 RMB a piece) for my phone. Walked around and saw the city. Took a little while to get used to how people looked at me, but it wasn't as bad as I thought, noone was really eyeballing me. Very few spoke english though, and the ones that do and who approaches me automatically meets the sceptic, cautious Marcus.</p>

<p>Claims they're a global fastfood chain. I've never seen them anywhere else but here in Shenzhen. Maybe their definition of global differs wildly from mine. Their name is awesome though: Kung-Fu, and they have Bruce Lee as logo; for that, I forgive them for this whole &quot;global&quot; thing.</p>

<p>Wetfloor seems like a dangerous guy with some mind- (and body-)blowing moves!</p>

<p>How about not slipping to begin with?</p>

<p>I really love engrish! Too bad it's not as common in HK as in mainland China :( In Shenzhen subway, there are signs that says &quot;Care for hands!&quot; :) (ie, don't let them be pinched in doors, and never be w/o manicure more than a week).</p>
<p>Now I've just entered Hong Kong territory and already fended away three times as many touts as in Shenzhen, and I'm still at the border station! Now it's time to take the subway to central HK and walk over to Chungking Mansions where there's supposed to be cheap hotels.</p>
