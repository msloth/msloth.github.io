      <p>We took the Jetstar late evening-flight to Da Nang. It was the most cramped flight I've ever had. I had just a few cm left for my legs, and the Vietnamese man sitting next to me was very friendly, a little too friendly so to speak. First I thought that he was just rude and taking up space but when I was almost falling asleep I felt his hand caressing my bare knee and I briskly woke up. He said sorry and didn't do it again. One hour later we landed and took a taxi (~150kr, 30km) from Da Nang to Hoi An and our hotel less than 5 min from the Cu Dai beach.</p>
<p>The streets are packed with small shops, most sell the usual things: shorts, tshirts, chopsticks and diverse small things. A pair of shorts cost about 20-30 kr. Then there are the restaurants and a few beauty salons/massageists. Four years ago, there was basically no-one on the 30km beach, but now there were plenty, including Vietnamese. The V come after sunset as they don't want to get a tan, to them white skin is more attractive and a lot of products like shower gel contain whitening chemicals.</p>
<p>The hotel was ok, a little run down but nice, and people were generally very friendly. I am aware that I am a walking wallet but I prefer to think of it less cynically. Some people here who iniatiate a dialog is really genuinely interested and just want to speak with you for a while with no business proposition at hand, in contrast to our previous trip to Egypt.</p>
<p>Dinner at a restaurant by the river. Their local speciality, Cau Lau, is veeery good. It's a bowl of noodles with beef, small pieces of crispy bread and herbs. Very najj.</p>
<p>Sugar cane juice, sold in bags for 5kr (nguyen thuy-price (~= falang/gaijin but not demeaning; means &quot;people foreigners&quot;).</p>
<p>Had grilled crabs (not the right word huh? Sounds strange) on the beach one night. Quite good but very messy.</p>
<p>Last night we went out in Hoi An (10 min taxiride from our hotel, 25kr), first at this insaaanely warm place called the Q-bar, then at the Before and Now bar. At midnight they started moving people to their second club at (our) beach in crammed minibuses :) Seems like a common effort so far, trying to make all tourists deaf by disco.</p>
<p>Now we are waiting for our domestic flight to Hanoi and Halong Bay. Johan, 194 proud cm over floor level, attracts the attention of more vertically challenged people.</p>
