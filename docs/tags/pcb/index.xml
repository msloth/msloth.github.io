      <title>Build: Nixie (in progress)</title>

      <description>Buildlog: Nixie (in progress) ðŸ”—Sneak peek ðŸ”—Before hitting the reflow oven.
Some Nixie tubes, IN-12A.
Some more Nixie tubes.
Meta ðŸ”—Previously&amp;hellip; ðŸ”—I saw this project, DekuNuken/exixe, and felt that hey, this is really cool and what I could use! But, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d like them differently.
For starters, I&amp;rsquo;d like them to run over I2C instead of SPI, to make it easier with strings of nixies. I&amp;rsquo;d also like to use firmware I&amp;rsquo;ve already developed (eg my contiki port for msp430) and chips I already had (msp430), aaaand I thought I could do a cleaner job with the layout of the transistors.</description>

      <title>Build: DigiDev</title>
      <link>https://tiliaradix.com/builds/build-digidev/</link>

      <description>Buildlog: DigiDev ðŸ”—The Goal ðŸ”—Design a board using inexpensive 2-layer design.
The Challenge ðŸ”—2-layer designs present challenges with RF compared to 4-layer designs, since the larger distance from signal layer to ground plane affects the RF negatively.
The Result ðŸ”—Using the thinnest PCB stackup the board house offers (0.8mm), and adjusting the RF path accordingly (RF feedline 51&amp;ndash;58&amp;ndash;66 mil, keepaway 128 mil), the board has excellent RF performance while being a more cost efficient alternative to 4-layer designs.</description>

      <title>Build: Ethernet CC1310 Gateway - eth1310</title>
      <link>https://tiliaradix.com/builds/build-eth1310/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 13 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://tiliaradix.com/builds/build-eth1310/</guid>
      <description>Buildlog: eth1310 ðŸ”—The Goal ðŸ”—Design a sub-GHz to Ethernet gateway that is cost efficient. Minimize size while still being able to solder by hand.
The Challenge ðŸ”—Ethernet and the CC1310 sub-GHz both present EMI challenges if not properly handled. RF and oscillator components should be as small as possible.
The Result ðŸ”—4 layer stack-up, impedance controlled boards made by JLCPCB.
Ethernet chip is the Microchip ENC28J60. Hanrun connector with integrated magnetics.</description>

      <title>Build: Wi-Fi CC1310 Gateway - wifi1310</title>
      <link>https://tiliaradix.com/builds/build-wifi1310/</link>

      <guid>https://tiliaradix.com/builds/build-wifi1310/</guid>
      <description>Buildlog: wifi1310 ðŸ”—The Goal ðŸ”—I wanted to make a small, user-friendly gateway. It should connect a sub-GHz 6lowpan mesh network (think eg Thread, or Amazon Sidewalk) to the Internet, via Wi-Fi.
The Challenge ðŸ”—Without the budget for custom RF work, nor space enough to be comfortable, make it work ðŸ˜„.
Obviously RF must work and be compliant.
It must fit in a nice commercial off the shelf (COTS) pre-made enclosure, and provide mechanisms for USB power, status LEDs, button, programming and test points.</description>

      <title>Build: SLIP CC1310 Gateway - slip1310</title>
      <link>https://tiliaradix.com/builds/build-slip1310/</link>

      <guid>https://tiliaradix.com/builds/build-slip1310/</guid>
      <description>Buildlog: serial1310 ðŸ”—Here&amp;rsquo;s the final result.
The Goal ðŸ”—A small sub-GHz serial gateway that can fit in a Raspberry Pi enclosure, without external antenna. It must use a serial connection (UART) to connect to the Raspberry Pi, and in turn to the Internet over SLIP or PPP.
The Challenge ðŸ”—Radio performance doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to be fantastic, but it cannot be crappy or have compliance-destroying spurious emissions or such.
Cost-efficient, and simple to assemble.</description>

      <title>Build: Brewtag</title>
      <link>https://tiliaradix.com/builds/build-brewtag/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 13 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://tiliaradix.com/builds/build-brewtag/</guid>
      <description>Buildlog: Brewtag ðŸ”—Soldered.
The Goal ðŸ”—Design a small sensor board that runs off coin cell batteries and uses high-accuracy sensors.
The use case is to measure ambient pressure differences of an elevator moving from floor to floor, to keep track of what floors are visited and when.
The Challenge ðŸ”—Small size, low cost, RF performance, EMI compliance, and protected against user errors such as battery upside down.
The pressure differences are quite small in the short travel distance between floors, so the pressure sensor must be quite accurate.</description>

      <title>Reflow Oven</title>
      <link>https://tiliaradix.com/builds/build-reflow-oven/</link>

      <guid>https://tiliaradix.com/builds/build-reflow-oven/</guid>
      <description>Basic Low-cost Reflow Oven ðŸ”—Sneak peek ðŸ”—The reflow oven hard at work.
Meta ðŸ”—&amp;ldquo;Professional&amp;rdquo; reflow ovens are pretty expensive.
Simple solution - use a small convection oven, add a precision temperature sensor and a controller, and let the controller heat the oven!
Why ðŸ”—SMD components are smaller, and many many components doesn&amp;rsquo;t even come as through-hole parts (THP) nowadays. It&amp;rsquo;s also generally cheaper, and the resulting PCB can be made smaller.</description>

      <title>Build: Big Red Button</title>
      <link>https://tiliaradix.com/builds/build-big-red-button/</link>

      <description>Buildlog: Big Red Button ðŸ”—Sneak peek ðŸ”—Meta ðŸ”—The Big Red Button is a product from Sparkfun that evokes memories of arcade games.
With an appealing dome and satisfying loud click, you cannot not click the button. But it lacks an equally appealing enclosure.
Let&amp;rsquo;s build one out of concrete.
For this project, I used
 1 Texas Instruments Sensortag 1 Adafruit Big Red Button 1 RGB LED Prototyping cables Concrete Various things for concrete mold  Why ðŸ”—Why not?</description>

      <title>Vector graphics for your PCBs</title>
      <link>https://tiliaradix.com/posts/vector-graphics-for-your-pcbs/</link>

      <guid>https://tiliaradix.com/posts/vector-graphics-for-your-pcbs/</guid>
      <description>TLDR ðŸ”—This tool converts SVG vector graphics to Cadsoft Eagle polygon. Get it here.
Why ðŸ”—Technology can even in its most raw and bare form certainly be beautiful. The bottom of a motherboard, with long, parallell, impedance-matched traces from PCI-connectors is a good example. A large BGA is another, with traces extending in every direction.
I&#39;ve long wanted to make my PCBs more beautiful, taking the few &amp;quot;colors&amp;quot; into full use.</description>

      <title>Clock with retro display</title>
      <link>https://tiliaradix.com/posts/clock-with-retro-display/</link>

      <guid>https://tiliaradix.com/posts/clock-with-retro-display/</guid>
      <description>HPDL-1414 clock ðŸ”—After having ported Contiki to the Launchpad, I was eager on doing something with it. I built this simple clock with a vintage HPDL-1414 &amp;quot;smart four-character 16-segment alphanumeric&amp;quot; display and a msp430g2553.
The soldered clock from above and bottom. There is a lot of solder flux residue, and lots of small black pieces of fabric from my bag, which lessens the appeal of the white solder mask. Quite nice though.</description>
