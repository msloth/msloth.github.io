Sneak peek 🔗Dettifoss Selfoss Hafragilsfoss What is it 🔗Fläskigt vattenfall och vacker utsikt.
Dettifoss enormt stort och första besöket, sen gå 1km söderut och ta Selfoss. Hafragilsfoss sist via bil.
Hög prio, men ligger lite avartigt till. Rätt långt från Akureyri, men kanske värt att ta en dag åt det. När vi sen reser från Akureyri så är det en lång biltur redan och det blir väldigt lång omväg att ta sig till Dettifoss et al den dagen.</description>

Sceniskt och häftiga basaltvattenfall som inte tar så lång tid på plats, och inte är en jättestor omväg. Men om vi är sjukt trötta efter Studlagil kanske skippa. Hellre Studlagil än detta.
Litlanefoss
 icelandtravelguide guidetoiceland europeanwaterfalls  Hengifoss
 icelandtravelguide WoW, bra beskrivning av hiken  What is it 🔗Litlanesfoss
Basaltomgivet vattenfall. Sceniskt! &amp;ldquo;also called Stuðlabergsfoss, which translates to Basalt Column Falls&amp;rdquo;
Litlanesfoss is not very visible from the hiking trail, man behöver gå fram till kanten.</description>

Prio MELLAN
Sneak peek 🔗What is it 🔗Vulkanisk krater.
Measures approximately (170 meters) in width with a circumference of (270 meters) and it is (55 meters) deep.
Believed to be 3,000-year-old, which seems to be approximately half of the age of other volcanic calderas found in Iceland. The age difference of Kerið Crater is the reason to why the slopes are in the hues of red rather than being volcanic black, while the iron deposits are extremely fresh in geological terms.</description>

      <description>prio MELLAN.
Mulagljufur == Mules Canyon. Sydöstra Island, mellan Brunnholl och MBC. Har konkurrens av massa Jökullar på vägen också, så även om den här är fin, så kanske skippa den. Andra raviner på andra dagar istället?
Verkar som att det är en grej man tar på vägen från Brunnholl till Midgard. Kolla in vad alternativen är och prioritera. Jökullar, båttur, etc.

What is it 🔗Ravin med basaltpelare, på vägen från Akureyri till Braz.
Studlafoss: basaltpelar-vattenfall på väg till Studlagil. Coolt att se.
Where is it 🔗When to go 🔗 Akureyri &amp;ndash; Studlagil: 2h 45m 290km Studlagil &amp;ndash; Braz GH: 2h 30m 175km  Därför logiskt att ta Studlagil på vägen från Akureyrei till Braz, trots att det blir en rätt tuff dag.</description>

      <description>The last day of this visit I went to the central business district. Actually, I started at the Shanghai Science and Technology Museum, which has several IMAX, 3D etc cinemas to choose from. Only problem was that they are closed on Mondays, sth that no other site said sth about except their own. My bad. So I walked down Century Avenue, hoping to find a good place to buy laptop sleeves, as I had read, but that was incorrect so instead I headed towards the Jin Mao, Shanghai World Financial Center (SWFC) and the Shanghai towers.</description>

      <description>The day after the Marriage Market I kept thinking of how different our cultures and societies are. And, how different China is from what I expected before I came. I expected something more&amp;hellip;.. communism, when it really is capitalism, consumerism and commersialism (is that a word even? Nvm). It&#39;s likely the most capitalist country I&#39;ve ever seen actually. Everywhere you look, there are things for sale, stores and shopping malls. Likely, it&#39;s different in rural China.</description>

      <description>&amp;quot;Hello! Do you want a girlfriend?&amp;quot; a Chinese man asked me. He was around 60, not that many teeth left in his lower jaw, wore a jacket and an honest smile. The Marriage Market, or Wedding Market, happens for a few hours every weekend in the park close to the Peoples square station (exit 5, around 12 to 15 or 17). Here worried parents meet to advertise their children. Grown up children, and single that is.</description>

      <description>So, I&#39;m staying a while in China after all the hard work is done. Today was the first day of my short stay without work so I started out by surfing the web for ideas on what to do and see. The first point is already done now, riding the Maglev train!
Maglev is actually more of a demo of the technology rather than sth that is really needed. It&#39;s a short track from Longyuan Road metro station to Pudong airport (the metro continues all the way to the airport already).</description>

      <description>It was fun in the taxi on the way to the venue where we were to talk, FUDAN Uni. I felt quite &#39;up&#39; by then, excited and positive. I felt like I kept noticing small details around me, as if I was very attentive, but lacked impulse suppressive skills. Like a kid on speed. Poor Alexa had to answer many insightful and nuanced questions about electric mopeds, trees dressed with ropes etc.</description>

Very mixed messages.
The second day, Nov 2nd, was the beginning of the event with a grand opening and unveiling of some plaquette or sth. We, Thiemo and I, didn&#39;t really understand everything. There were 400 Chinese and 3 Swedes. Prof Kalle from KTH were there as well and held a talk about IoT they were involved in. Everything else was in Chinese but we had headphones with real time translation by two translators.</description>

A week after returning home they had apparently decided and I was asked if I could go back go China and take care of it. Of course I&#39;ll do it!</description>

      <description>My travels are coming to an end again. Today I wanted to go shopping in Shenzhen (as I think HK has more posh stores, and that&#39;s not really my cup of tea). At 1030 I went down to the subway and at 1230 I had passed the borders on the Shenzhen side. Most EU-countries get (free) visa on arrival to HK, so no problem returning. To Shenzhen, you can get a visa on arrival (ca 30min, costs 168 RMB for most EU), but, and this is crucial: you must have the fee in RMB, HKD are not accepted.</description>

      <title>Vantage viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://tiliaradix.com/posts/vantage-viewpoint/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So evening of my first stay in Apple guesthouse I went to see the HK skyline from Victoria peaks. You basically take the subway to Central, follow the signs (Beijing, Shenzhen and HK are all very good at that, signs) to the peak trams. There, there is a 30-45 minute wait until you get to board the tram, which costs 65HKD both ways including entrance fee to the viewpoint (Terrace 428, which I would recommend, it&#39;s a nice view from there). Remember this if you go here: &lt;em&gt;sit on the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; side of the tram&lt;/em&gt; (seen from the queue). I was smug about having caught a windowseat on the left side only to realize that all Chinese sat on the other side. Ooops. They got a great view over the city, but I saw some trees so I&#39;m happy anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw on Google that the sunset would occur at 1828, so I tried to time it but got a little late. According to a nice Spanish guy I talked to, I didn&#39;t miss much due to fog and air pollution. One sad thing was the (chinese) lady at the tram entrance that was convinced that the CIA made brain experiments on her and that she would soon become a moron [sic]. She had big posters and walked up and down the queue talking to people and handing out flyers. Kind of surprised it wasn&#39;t tinfoil hats she was handing out, or that she wasn&#39;t sitting in a Faradays cage on a Segway or sth, like a cooler version of the Popemobile.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Funky Chungking Mansions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had heard that there are many guesthouses at the &lt;em&gt;Chungking Mansions&lt;/em&gt; building in downtown HK. In fact, there are about 200 of them apparently (I read somewhere). Now, some of them are better than others and if you, like me, are arriving at 21 o&#39;clock, tired, &lt;em&gt;looking&lt;/em&gt; tired, there is a small chance for you to get the best offers from the indian touts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I waved off a few, declined others and went to 5th floor w another. So I stayed one night at Kamals. The cleanliness was ok, but sth that I didn&#39;t notice when looking at the room was the smell, like an indian kitchen. I thought it would go away, but it didn&#39;t. I did. The smell won.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After freshing up, I went for a walk and enjoyed HK. Not as I expected. Then I was so tired that I crashed, like a russian fighter jet at an aero fair, but in a bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day after, I moved to Apple guesthouse instead. Small room but soooo much better. And friendly filipino staff, not the sorry-I-bother-you-for-breathing-your-air indians at Kamal, they are rude. Basically the same thing: AC, own WC and shower, but so much better. And cheaper, 220HKD instead of 300(!). Some places have singles w shared bathroom for 70, according to one I talked to. (and 1 HKD is slightly less than 1 RMB or 1kr)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Some differences I noticed immediately:
 People don&#39;t look at me because I&#39;m not Chinese people (guys) wear shorts, that was rare in Beijing and Shenzhen people know english; ratio unknown, but in Shenzhen close to null, in Beijing a few more. MANY more foreigners! And not only westerners. Indians, pakistanis, africans (don&#39;t know what country, looks middle-african to me)  Simple enough \\(•,•)/</description>

      <description>I arrived in Shenzhen and had quite the difficulties finding the hotel, even though I followed the directions from a commenter on hotels.com. It is a very cheap hotel, only 130 RMB/night (the others ranged 400-600). I soon found out why. The building also housed a lot of apartments and other stuff. I got a room at the 11th floor of 30. There was no free dinner reception, no complimentary wifi (but I could borrow the managers computer on the 28th floor, if I wanted to let them log every credential and login I would enter.</description>

      <description>The second to last day of Ubicomp 2011 included a banquet. After the last session of presentations, we were taken in buses, comfortable coaches, to the lake by the Summer Palace. The driver was absolutely ruthless, driving fast, honking his horn and rarely steering away from bikers or pedestrians. Not even kids were safe from this beast of the road. Biggest goes first I guess. Well, no casualties at least.</description>

      <description>Went downtown to see the city a bit more and decided to go to their equivalent of Bangkoks MBK: the Silk market building. Despite the name, there were not much silk and the harsh signs in the roof condemning piracy (sth along the lines of &amp;quot;Buy original brand, do not buy fake copy!&amp;quot;) had little effect on the offers, customers or anything at all. Don&#39;t know if there were anything original there, &amp;quot;original copy&amp;quot; perhaps.</description>

And here is the Google sponsored reception. The banquet is on tuesday though.

      <description>Yesterday we (Jordi and I) mostly worked on the presentation for today, but in the evening we took the subway downtown. We went to see the Forbidden city and the Himmelska fridens torg (a few call it Tianamen square though), or rather we just took the subway there and walked from there.
At the street there were many guys walking around selling their service of snapping a pic of you and printing it on a portable printer.</description>

      <description>The flight with Qatar Airways went well. Got an ok seat, but what makes them slightly better is all the complimentary stuff, like free drinks (incl whiskey :) ), and the nice entertainment system. No dancing bears, but a screen in front of you with a lot of movies to choose from. 6h to Doha, cap of Qatar, 2h wait, then 7:40h to Beijing. Took a taxi to the hotel, Park Plaza Beijing Science park, only ca 100Y (~100kr).</description>

      <description>These are some leftovers I haven&#39;t written about before.
There were some eerie, creepy animals in the Cambodian forest that scared the s!!t out of us when we were exploring a temple that had closed for the day and was void of people. The sun had just set when these animals, called &amp;quot;rajj&amp;quot; started synchronizing their sound in time and frequency. Like being in a horror movie.

      <description>We took the Jetstar late evening-flight to Da Nang. It was the most cramped flight I&#39;ve ever had. I had just a few cm left for my legs, and the Vietnamese man sitting next to me was very friendly, a little too friendly so to speak. First I thought that he was just rude and taking up space but when I was almost falling asleep I felt his hand caressing my bare knee and I briskly woke up.</description>

      <description>Cu Chi is the area (district? Village?) where, among other things the Americans had a big army base during the war and the VC built an intricate system of tunnels, 200 km of them. The reason was to hide VC fighters, covert regrouping and surprise attacks.
As the US used B52 bombers with 200-450 kg bombs, carpet bombing large areas at a time, the VC built the tunnels in levels. First level was &amp;lt;=3m deep and would not survive those bombs.</description>

      <description>The night before we left Saigon/HCMC we decided to head on out, making the city the most insecure since the &#39;70-ies. Turns out Saigon had a few surprises itself.
According to Google searches, the best clubs would be Gossip club, Apocalypse Now, Lush, and Velvet. We decided to start at the supposed THE place to go to: Gossip.
No entrance fee, nice! Thank you pale falang-skin and shining smile ;) The music was reeeeeally heavy, the volume was insane and there was a crowd dancing on a small dance floor podium in the center.</description>

      <description>We went to see the War remnants museum, which is a museum for the Vietnam/American war. There were some fighter jets, tanks, old bombs and equipment and guns on display but most moving was the very many photos and stories from both V&#39;s and A&#39;s.
Saw a woman/girl that took photos of many of the nasty pics of mutilated bodies etc. Interesting. She seemed focused on those.
There were also devices from one of the worlds first wireless sensor network deployments on display, the ADSID.</description>

      <description>So, we have now left Cambodia behind us. We visited some more temples, but left many behind. There are simply too many! Bantey Srey is an area which is supposed to be good, but 37 km from Siem Reap so we didn&#39;t have time for it.
Siem Reap is a small town, ca 10.000 inhabitants, but it has a club I feel Stockholm is lacking. We joined some locals for some interesting dishes, and I quote, &amp;quot;Egg has baby&amp;quot;.</description>

      <description>We took the Tuk tuk to Angkor Wat early in the morning. Good to get there so early but it was unfortunately cloudy.
More tuktuk
We didn&#39;t stay at AW, instead we left for Ta Prohm which is considered a sunset temple, ie looking better at the sunset. Thus, it&#39;s more empty during the morning.
Also visited Ta Keo.
Saw a cool centipede which fortunately enough was slow and didn&#39;t seem to have an appetite for human flesh.</description>

      <description>Yes, I heard right, there def is corruption. After shooing away the expected touts, first thing that happens is that a welldecorated police officer sees my shopping bag of food and &amp;quot;asks&amp;quot; me to give something because he&#39;s hungry. In front of other cops and tourists, without shame. I find it a little funny and gives him a bun (fika ftw!). Next thing, they ask for 25$ instead of 20$. Wasn&#39;t a problem though, I just said clearly and with my thunderous authority that it&#39;s only 20.</description>

      <description>Chatuchak market was as cramped and chaotic as I remembered, so many booths and people in narrow lanes. The roof made it a very warm and humid experience, although we didn&amp;rsquo;t buy anything there were plenty of maybes. Then we roamed the Siam malls and I bought nice goggles for a really nice price (900B is ca 180kr). Looking forward to using them!

From CDG it was a 45 min at 8.5€ trainride. Never been to Paris before, and it was very nice! I will come back here some other time :).
