      <description>We had almost five hours transfertime at Charles de Gaulles, Paris,before the flight to Bangkok so we took a quick detour to have some red wine at a small café close to Notre Dame. From CDG it was a 45 min at 8.5€ trainride. Never been to Paris before, and it was very nice! I will come back here some other time :).
We flew with Air France and I must say I&#39;m impressed!</description>
