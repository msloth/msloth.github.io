  silent.c
  Simple program that periodically toggles the LEDs on a Tmote Sky mote. Has Serial
  shell enabled. Issuing the commad 'ut' over shell toggles the COOJA visualizer
  showing lines drawn between the node and some other nodes (COOJA ID 1 to 10).
  This file is used in demonstrating some features of COOJA and MSPSim.
