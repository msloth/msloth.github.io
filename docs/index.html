The term more or less signifies something rare, forgotten in time and found way later. Often a rural farmer or excentric collector. While tanks arenâ€™t that usual, more common is it to find old cars.
This diorama is a play on that theme.
Here, a farmer had a German WW2 tank in his barn, forgotten in time.</div>

Why ðŸ”—We recently bought a soundbar system for our TV. The system includes a subwoofer. Not great, not terrible, but enough to potentially disturb neighbors. This calls for some kind of stand to separate the subwoofer-structure from the house-structure so the big badabooms doesnâ€™t make for disturbance calls.
Also, the sides are dressed in a fabric mesh, and I want to raise it from the floor enough so that the vacuum cleaner wonâ€™t hit it.</div>

In our daily lives, we are governed by time and schedules. We may wake up at 6:30 AM, take the bus at 7:34 AM, start work at 8:10 AM, pick up from school at 4:00 PM - based on synchronized and often fixed times of day.</div>

The Result ðŸ”—Using the thinnest PCB stackup the board house offers (0.8mm), and adjusting the RF path accordingly (RF feedline 51â€“58â€“66 mil, keepaway 128 mil), the board has excellent RF performance while being a more cost efficient alternative to 4-layer designs.</div>

But even with a wireless mesh network, the IoT devices may become disconnected. We then need to store their data offline â€“ and have them automatically post their data when they come back online.</div>

Every single Internet of Things (IoT) device needs an antenna.
The antenna is crucial: it may make or break the communication with your devices. A good antenna will give you a good wireless range. A bad antenna may cause your devices to not even be reachable in the field.
IoT devices are designed to be small, have a long wireless range, and have a long battery life.</div>

The Challenge ðŸ”—Small size, low cost, RF performance, EMI compliance, and protected against user errors such as battery upside down.
The pressure differences are quite small in the short travel distance between floors, so the pressure sensor must be quite accurate.</div>
