      <description>Buildlog: Brewtag ðŸ”—The Goal ðŸ”—Design a small sensor board that runs off coin cell batteries and uses high-accuracy sensors, for use in measuring ambient pressure differences of an elevator moving from floor to floor.
The Challenge ðŸ”—Small size, low cost, RF performance, EMI compliance, and protected against user errors such as battery upside down.
The Result ðŸ”—Mechanics, enclosure ðŸ”—Schematics ðŸ”—Layout ðŸ”—</description>

      <title>Build: DigiDev</title>

      <description>Buildlog: DigiDev ðŸ”—The Goal ðŸ”—Design a board using inexpensive 2-layer design.
The Challenge ðŸ”—2-layer designs present challenges with RF compared to 4-layer designs, since the larger distance from signal layer to ground plane affects the RF negatively.
The Result ðŸ”—Using the thinnest PCB stackup the board house offers, and adjusting the RF path accordingly, the board has excellent RF performance while being a more cost efficient alternative to 4-layer designs.</description>

      <description>Buildlog: eth1310 ðŸ”—The Goal ðŸ”—Design a sub-GHz to Ethernet gateway that is cost efficient. Minimize size while still being able to solder by hand.
The Challenge ðŸ”—Ethernet and the CC1310 sub-GHz both present EMI challenges if not properly handled. RF and oscillator components should be as small as possible.
The Result ðŸ”—A 4 by 10 cm board with excellent RF performance, power from USB-C, and no EMI issues.

      <title>Vector graphics for your PCBs</title>
      <link>https://tiliaradix.com/posts/vector-graphics-for-your-pcbs/</link>

      <description>TLDR ðŸ”—This tool converts SVG vector graphics to Cadsoft Eagle polygon. Get it here.
Why ðŸ”—Technology can even in its most raw and bare form certainly be beautiful. The bottom of a motherboard, with long, parallell, impedance-matched traces from PCI-connectors is a good example. A large BGA is another, with traces extending in every direction.
I&#39;ve long wanted to make my PCBs more beautiful, taking the few &amp;quot;colors&amp;quot; into full use.</description>

      <title>Clock with retro display</title>

      <description>HPDL-1414 clock ðŸ”—After having ported Contiki to the Launchpad, I was eager on doing something with it. I built this simple clock with a vintage HPDL-1414 &amp;quot;smart four-character 16-segment alphanumeric&amp;quot; display and a msp430g2553.
The soldered clock from above and bottom. There is a lot of solder flux residue, and lots of small black pieces of fabric from my bag, which lessens the appeal of the white solder mask. Quite nice though.</description>
